# Digital-Catalogue

## Description

I have built a virtual catalog using Nest.js on the backend side, similar to the one offered by the university https://studenti.pub.ro/, to display and manage the final academic performance (average, number of absences) of students from a specific school or high school in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

Students will be added to a database where their grades, absences, and personal data are stored for the long term.

The web server represents the backend of the application and is responsible for handling requests received from the client (web interface) and processing them. The web server receives HTTP requests from the client, interprets them, and produces appropriate responses. It communicates with the database using a specific driver that allows it to perform operations such as deletion, reading, and modification of stored values.

The implemented functionalities include adding a student to the database, deleting a student from the database, modifying the final grade, changing the number of absences, and displaying all students in the database at the current time.
