# Digital-Catalogue

## Description

I have built a virtual catalog using Nest.js with TypeScript on the backend side and MongoDB for the database, similar to the one offered by the university [UPB Catalogue](https://studenti.pub.ro/ 'UPB Catalogue'), to display and manage the final academic performance (average, number of absences) of students from a specific school or high school in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

Students will be added to a database where their grades, absences, and personal data are stored for the long term.

The server communicates with the database using a specific driver that allows it to perform operations such as deletion, reading, and modification of stored values.

The implemented functionalities include adding a student to the database, deleting a student from the database, modifying the final grade, changing the number of absences, and displaying all students in the database at the current time.
